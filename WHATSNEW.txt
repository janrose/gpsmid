GpsMid 0.4.55
       *** Usability ***
       - support for touchscreen devices (works also with mouse in MicroEmulator):
         - touch and drag to pan around the map
         - touch and drag to scroll in search results
       - support for QWERT keyboards in the Search dialog
       - new keyboard shortcuts for QWERT keyboards in the map screen and some changes to numeric keyboard shortcuts
         (see http://gpsmid.wiki.sourceforge.net/Keyboard_Layout)
       - new custom alert boxes for the map screen cover the map only partially when displayed
       - Setup Dialog speed improved
       - Results from "Search / Nearest POI" include the compass direction now
       - added backlight method for Siemens mobiles to Generic-Full (thx beni123)
       - display backlight dimming for phones like Nokia E90 that support this
         (use left / right keys during "Backlight ON" message to check out if dimming has an effect on your mobile)
       - show available key shortcuts in Setup / Key shortcuts
       - Favorites and Waypoints in the Search Dialog:
         When there are waypoints ending with "*" they will show up as Favorites in the search dialog for quick access.
         By pressing the "*"-key you can toggle to show all waypoints.
         Typing a key will narrow down the favorites / waypoints list.
         With the "#"-key you can toggle to sort the waypoints / favorites by name or distance.
         Typing at least 2 keys will give normal name search results as before.         
       *** OSM Editing ***
       - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! describe here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
       *** Routing ***
       - Routing to POIs/waypoints is now possible - GpsMid will route you to the closest routable way
       - highlighting the route solution path (the route solution is drawn on top if the map is synched with
         the GPS receiver but when panning manually it will respect the layer information),
         the minimum width of the route solution path can be specified in Setup/Routing Options 
       - improved off-route detection
       - routing instructions for entering and exiting motorways, for roundabouts, tunnels,
         for bearing if two alternative ways lead straight on and for following the street until further notice,
         when there's no instruction for at least 1200 meters
       - browse the route instructions with up/down keys (can be deactivated in Setup)
       - display the name of the street the route instruction leads into
       - skip half turn instructions if the street name stays the same and straight-ons
       - improved recalculation detection: you can now set the target, calculate the route
         then Start Gps. When there's a new position from the GPS the route recalculation will
         be automatically performed
       - some wrong direction arrows are fixed
       *** Tracks and Waypoints ***
       - Perform actions like export/delete on multiple selected tracks (thx mbaeurle)
       - Ability to rename tracks and waypoints
       - Waypoint names can now be entered with up to 255 chars (instead of 20)
	   - Waypoints are now automatically exported inside tracks (thx jkpj)
       - When sending waypoints you are now asked for a name (Waypoints.gpx remains default filename)
       - The map is centered at the start point when displaying a track
       - Send tracks directly to Openstreetmap internet url
		 if "upload to OSM" is specified as GPX receiver
		 and OSM Account in Setup is specified
	   - bug fix for file import not working on some phones (thx mbaeurle + colleague)
	   - optimizations for waypoint label drawing (thx mbaeurle) 
       *** GPS ***
       - JSR-179: Some devices (e.g. Nokia E71 and E90) did not show the speed / rotate the map to the driving direction. 
       *** Recordings ***
       - Added feature to send an SMS with the current map position (map center)
         if JSR-120 is available. It is also possible
         to save the specified recipient as default recipient,
         even when leaving the form with the Back command
       *** Map ***
       - added "Name Check" feature to Overview/Filter Map
         This can be used to show only unnamed/named or ways/areas/POIs containing a certain string in the map
       - Place labels (city, town, village, hamlet, suburb) can now be hidden using the Map Features dialog 
       - double press of 9 / single press of U-key toggles manual rotation mode (use left / right to rotate)
       - added POIs for beacons, towers and power objects to high-style.zip (thx mbaeurle) 
       - added POIs for emergency phones and tourist informations to normal style-file and high-style.zip (thx mbaeurle) 
       - fixed crashes when displaying route connections via Debug Options
       *** Midlet creation with Osm2GpsMid ***
       - Osm2GpsMid is now compiled to be compatible with Java 1.5 Runtime (for example on older Mac OSX)
       - use HTTP compression for downloading map data if the server supports it
       *** Others ***
       - speed limit alert - configurable in Setup / Sounds & Alerts (thx jkpj)
       - many more small improvements and bugfixes

         shows the chosen hideable POI/Area/Way types
         in the map regardless of zoom level for an overview.
         This can be useful to get a quick overview of a certain POI/Area/Way type in the area, i.e. hotels or railways.
         You can optionally choose to show POI/Area/Way types that are
         not selected in the Overview list normal or filter them out from display.
       - Areas can now be hidden in Map Features dialog
       - speed up and rendering fixes for way labels in the map

         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar --bounds=23.48,34.78,26.37,35.7 osmxapi
       - create midlet from whole osm file if no properties file and no bounds are specified, i.e.:
