GpsMid 0.4.x
       - Rotate map to driving direction
         (specify default rotation in Display Options or Map Features
          or toggle rotation by quickly pressing 5 twice)
       - increased robustness of track and waypoint storage
       - Full text search (Search / Fulltext Search)
       - Take pictures from GpsMid if JSR-135 or JSR-234 is supported by phone
       - Record audio notes with GpsMid
       - sounds section in style file / sound playback routines supporting *.amr, *.wav and *.mp3, .amr recommended 
       - sound for GPS start / stop (CONNECT and DISCONNECT sound in style file OR internal melody)
       - experimental voice routing instructions (sound names see style-file.xml of high-style.zip)
       - priority and specialisation conditions in style-file for POIs and ways
       - pois and areas marked with "hideable=false" in style-file
         are not allowed be hidden using map features anymore (useful i.e. to keep place names)
       - "Clear Target" menu entry to remove route arrows and navigation line
       - automatically default new midlets to correct backlight method for devices that were listed
         with backlight method at http://gpsmid.wiki.sourceforge.net/DevicesList
       - JSR-179: initial default location provider is set to JSR-179
         if available on device and supported by app defined in .properties file
       - JSR-179: getExtraInfo-NMEA-logging
       - JSR-179: show satellites in overlay if device gives $GPGSV-information
       - BT-GPS: auto-reconnect feature
       - BT-GPS: Remove the Stop recording command if the Location receiver gets closed
       - Manually enter new waypoints by coordinates 
         (i.e. 48° 30' 45" or 48° 30.75' or 48.5125° and leave the other fields empty)
       - Usability: Restructured Map Menu
       - Usability: allow to specify bounds on command line if no properties file is specified:
         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar --bounds=23.48,34.78,26.37,35.7 osmxapi
       - Usability: create midlet from whole osm file if no properties file and no bounds are specified, i.e.:
         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar greece.osm.bz2
       - Usability: show busy screen while discovering BT devices
       - Scale splash screen on devices with more than 176x220 and enough memory
       - speed up and rendering fixes for way labels in the map
       - map "freeze" bug on SE phones fixed
       - delayed map draw bug fixed
       - Areas can now be hidden in Map Features dialog
       - "Search=>Overview/Filter Map" or double-press "*"
         shows the chosen hideable POI/Area/Way types
         in the map regardless of zoom level for an overview.
         This can be useful to get a quick overview of a certain POI/Area/Way type in the area, i.e. hotels or railways.
         You can optionally choose to show POI/Area/Way types that are
         not selected in the Overview list normal or filter them out from display.
