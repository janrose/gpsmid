GpsMid 0.4.55
       *** Usability ***
       - touchscreen devices: touch and drag to pan around the map
       - added backlight method for Siemens mobiles to Generic-Full (thx beni123)
       *** Tracks and Waypoints ***
       - Perform actions like export/delete on multiple selected tracks (thx mbaeurle)
       - Ability to rename tracks and waypoints
       - Waypoint names can now be entered with up to 255 chars (instead of 20)
       - When sending waypoints you are now asked for a name (Waypoints.gpx remains default filename)
       *** GPS ***
       - JSR-179: Some devices (e.g. Nokia E71 and E90) did not show the speed / rotate the map to the driving direction. 
       *** Recordings ***
       - Added feature to send an SMS with the current map position (map center)
         if JSR-120 is available. It is also possible
         to save the specified recipient as default recipient,
         even when leaving the form with the Back command
       *** Map ***
       - added "Name Check" feature to Overview/Filter Map
         This can be used to show only unnamed/named ways/areas/POIs in the map
       - fixed crashes when displaying route connections via Debug Options
       *** Midlet creation with Osm2GpsMid ***
       - Osm2GpsMid is now compiled to be compatible with Java 1.5 Runtime (for example on older Mac OSX)
       - use HTTP compression for downloading map data if the server supports it

GpsMid 0.4.51
       *** Navigation ***
       - Rotate map to driving direction
         (specify default rotation in Display Options or Map Features
          or toggle rotation by quickly pressing 5 twice)
       - Faster and more correct route calculation
       - Routing from unnamed streets is now possible
         (GpsMid will route from nearest routable way)       
       - experimental voice routing instructions (sound names see style-file.xml of high-style.zip)
       - "Clear Target" menu entry to remove route arrows and navigation line
       - Possibility to show the routing graph as a route debuging feature
       *** Map ***
       - One-way street arrows in the map
       - "Search=>Overview/Filter Map" or double-press "*"
         shows the chosen hideable POI/Area/Way types
         in the map regardless of zoom level for an overview.
         This can be useful to get a quick overview of a certain POI/Area/Way type in the area, i.e. hotels or railways.
         You can optionally choose to show POI/Area/Way types that are
         not selected in the Overview list normal or filter them out from display.
       - Areas can now be hidden in Map Features dialog
       - speed up and rendering fixes for way labels in the map
       - delayed map draw bug fixed	   
       - some new map features in high-style.zip
       *** Tracks and Waypoints ***
       - increased robustness of track and waypoint storage (thx mbaeurle)
       - Enter new waypoints by coordinates using Recordings.../Enter waypoint (thx mbaeurle)
         (i.e. 48° 30' 45" or 48° 30.75' or 48.5125° and leave the other fields empty)
       - Exporting and importing waypoints always use UTF-8 now (thx bilboq)
       - Existing waypoints.gpx files are now correctly overwritten (thx bilboq)
       - "Export all" command for GPX tracklogs
       *** GPS ***
       - BT-GPS: auto-reconnect feature
       - BT-GPS: Remove the Stop recording command if the Location receiver gets closed
       - sound for GPS start / stop (thx mbaeurle)
       - CONNECT and DISCONNECT sound in style file OR internal melody
       - JSR-179: initial default location provider is set to JSR-179
         if available on device and supported by app defined in .properties file
       - JSR-179: getExtraInfo-NMEA-logging
       - JSR-179: show satellites in overlay if device gives $GPGSV-information
	   - Ability to suspend track recordings and later continue in the same track
	   - Include an Odometer for the recorded tracks 
       *** Audio & Picture Recording ***
       - Take pictures from GpsMid if JSR-135 or JSR-234 is supported by phone
       - Record audio notes with GpsMid
       - Geotag pictures in exif header (experimental)
       *** GpsMid Usability ***
       - Restructured Map Menu
       - map "freeze" bug on SE phones fixed
       - new Full text search (Search / Fulltext Search)
       - More international characters are mapped to number keys in the Search form
       - show busy screen while discovering BT devices
       - automatically default new midlets to correct backlight method for devices that were listed
         with backlight method at http://gpsmid.wiki.sourceforge.net/DevicesList
       - Scale splash screen on devices with more than 176x220 and enough memory
       - show midlet version and bundling date in splash screen
       *** Osm2GpsMid Usability ***
       - A graphical Osm2GpsMid Wizard starts if no command line parameters are given
       - allow to specify bounds on command line if no properties file is specified:
         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar --bounds=23.48,34.78,26.37,35.7 osmxapi
       - create midlet from whole osm file if no properties file and no bounds are specified, i.e.:
         java -Xmx1024M -jar Osm2GpsMid-0.4.x.jar greece.osm.bz2
       - display configuration summary of parameters that are used for midlet creation	   
       *** Style File ***
       - priority and specialisation conditions in style-file for POIs and ways
       - pois and areas marked with "hideable=false" in style-file
         are not allowed be hidden using map features anymore (useful i.e. to keep place names)
       - sounds section in style file / sound playback routines supporting *.amr, *.wav and *.mp3, .amr recommended
       - descriptionscale for areas allowing to specify scale when type description is shown
